# lnclk
`lnclk` (pronounced lineclock) is a minimalist clock displaying time as a progress bar of 1 pixel of height.
Currently, it displays seconds but it will be configurable.

# Installation
Clone the repository : 
`git clone https://github.com/Askrenteam/lnclk.git`

Build the files :
`make`

# Configuration
You can configure the background and foreground colors of the bar in `~/.config/lnclk/config`.
Example configuration file : 
```
fg = #906010
bg = #101010
```
_*Note :* spaces count around the '='. This is a known limitation I'll be working on._
